## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `django-baton` for local development.

1. Fork the `django-baton` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/django-baton.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development

    Start the test app (login admin:admin)::

    ```
    $ cd testapp
    $ python3 -m venv .virtualenv
    $ cd app
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Switch the baton js path in `base_site.html`::

    ```
    <!-- <script src="{% static 'baton/app/dist/baton.min.js' %}"></script> comment the compiled src and uncomment the webpack served src -->
    <script src="http://localhost:8080/dist/baton.min.js"></script>
    ```

    Start both the django testapp and the js app (the last one in watch mode)::

    ```
    $ cd baton/static/baton/app
    $ npm install
    $ npm run dev
    ```

    Now you'll see live all your changes in the testapp.

4. Create a branch for local development::

    ```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass all tests (with the test app running)::

    ```
    $ cd testapp/app
    $ python manage.py test
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. Python code should follow PEP8 guidelines, Javascript code should respect the `.eslintrc` configuration.
3. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.
4. The pull request should work for python >= 3, Django >= 2.1, and for PyPy. Check 
   https://travis-ci.org/otto-torino/django-baton/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
