Customization
=============

.. image:: images/customization.png

It's easy to customize the appeareance of baton.

You can override all the css variables, just create a `baton/css/root.css` file and serve it from an app listed before baton in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

You can also create themes directly from the admin site, just surf to `/admin/baton/batontheme/`. There can be only one active theme, if present, the saved content is used instead of the `root.css` file. So just copy the content of that file in the field and change the colors you want. Be aware that the theme content is considered safe and injected into the page as is, so be carefull.

.. important:: You can find ready to use themes and new ideas at `otto-torino/django-baton-themes <https://github.com/otto-torino/django-baton-themes>`_

If you need heavy customization or you need to customize the `primary` and `secondary` colors, you can edit and recompile the JS app which resides in `baton/static/baton/app`.

The Baton js app
----------------

The js app which **baton** provides is a modern js app, written using es2015 and stage-0 code features, which are then transpiled to a code browsers can understand using `babel <https://babeljs.io/>`_ and `webpack <https://webpack.github.io/>`_.

All css are written using sass on top of bootstrap, and transpiled with babel so that the final output is a single js file ready to be included in the html template.

The app entry point is `index.js <https://github.com/otto-torino/django-baton/blob/master/baton/static/baton/app/src/index.js>`_, where the only variable attached to the window object ``Baton`` is defined.

All the js modules used are inside the `core <https://github.com/otto-torino/django-baton/tree/master/baton/static/baton/app/src/core>`_ directory.

Change the baton appearance
---------------------------

It's quite easy to change completely the appearance of baton, just make the changes you like and recompile the app. Then make sure to serve your recompiled app in place of the baton one.

Here comes what you have to do:

- place one of your django apps before `baton` in the `INSTALLED_APPS` settings, I'll call this app ROOTAPP
- clone the repository (or copy the `static/baton/app` dir from your virtualenv) ::

      $ git clone https://github.com/otto-torino/django-baton.git

- install the app requirements ::

    $ cd django-baton/baton/static/baton/app/
    $ npm install

- edit the ``src/styles/_variables.scss`` file as you like
- recompile the app ::

    $ npm run compile

- copy the generated bundle ``dist/baton.min.js`` in ``ROOTAPP/static/baton/app/dist/``

You can also perform live development, in this case:

- place one of your django apps before `baton` in the `INSTALLED_APPS` settings, I'll call this app ROOTAPP
- create an admin base_site template ``ROOTAPP/templates/admin/base_site.html`` with the following content: ::

    {% extends "admin/base.html" %}
    {% load static baton_tags %}
    {% load i18n %}

    {% block title %}{% if subtitle %}{{ subtitle }} | {% endif %}{{ title }} | {{ site_title|default:_('Django site admin') }}{% endblock title %}

    {% block extrahead %}
        {% baton_config as conf %}
        {{ conf | json_script:"baton-config" }}
        <script charset="utf-8">
            (function () {
                // immediately set the theme mode to avoid flashes
                var systemTheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
                var theme = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('baton-config').textContent).forceTheme || localStorage.getItem('baton-theme') || (systemTheme.matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
                document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].setAttribute('data-bs-theme', theme);
            })()
        </script>
        <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport" />
        <script src="{% static 'baton/app/dist/baton.min.js' %}"></script>
        <!-- <script src="http://localhost:8080/static/baton/app/dist/baton.min.js"></script> -->
        <script src="{% static 'baton/js_snippets/init_baton.js' %}"></script>
        {% baton_theme %}
    {% endblock extrahead %}

    {% block branding %}
    <div class="baton-startup-overlay"></div>
    <h1 id="site-name"><a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">{{ site_header|default:_('Django administration') }}</a></h1>
    {% endblock branding %}

    {% block nav-global %}{% endblock nav-global %}

    {% block footer %}
        {% footer %}
    {% endblock footer %}

- or you can edit directly the baton template and switch the comment of the two lines: ::

    <!-- <script src="{% static 'baton/app/dist/baton.min.js' %}"></script> comment the compiled src and uncomment the webpack served src -->
    <script src="http://localhost:8080/static/baton/app/dist/baton.min.js"></script>

- start the webpack development server ::

    $ npm run dev:baton

Now while you make your changes to the js app (css included), webpack will update the bundle automatically, so just refresh the page and you'll see your changes.
